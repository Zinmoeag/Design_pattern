The LSP matters because it helps you avoid unexpected bugs and errors when you use inheritance and polymorphism in your code. Inheritance allows you to reuse and extend the functionality of an existing class, while polymorphism allows you to use different subclasses interchangeably, depending on the context. However, if you don't follow the LSP, you might end up with subclasses that behave differently or inconsistently from the superclass, causing confusion and frustration for the users and the developers. For example, imagine you have a superclass called Animal, and a subclass called Penguin that inherits from Animal. If Animal has a method called fly, and Penguin overrides it with a method that throws an exception, then you have violated the LSP, because you can't use Penguin as an Animal without breaking the program.
